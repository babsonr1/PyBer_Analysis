# PyBer Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the rates of drivers, fares, and rides of three different types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. In the scope of this class, the purpose was to use Jupyter Notebook, which includes pandas and matplotlib, to form dataframes and graphs. In the course of the module, scatter plots, bubble charts, line graphs, pie charts, and box-and-whisker charts were used to display different aspects of the information given.
