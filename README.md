# PyBer Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the rates of drivers, fares, and rides of three different types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. In the scope of this class, the purpose was to use Jupyter Notebook, which includes pandas and matplotlib, to form dataframes and graphs. In the course of the module, scatter plots, bubble charts, line graphs, pie charts, and box-and-whisker charts were used to display different aspects of the information given.
## Results
The data from the files show that there are significantly more rides, drivers, and fares in urban cities, followed by suburban and rural, respectively. There are 4 times more suburban rides than rural, and 1.6 times more rides in urban cities than suburban (1,625: 625: 125, urban: suburban: rural). There are 5.3 times more drivers in suburban cities than rural, and 3.9 times more drivers in urban cities than suburban (2,405: 490: 78, urban: suburban: rural). Suburban cities brought in roughly 3.5 times more money than rural cities, and urban cities doubling that of suburban ones. The opposite trends occur for average price per ride and average price per driver. Each step in decreasing size is between 10% and 250% of the price of the next size larger.


This data can be seen in the below table:

To further the analysis, income per week for the first half of the fiscal year was drawn onto a line graph. There is a peak in sales among all city types in mid-February. Urban cities always have higher sales than suburban and rural cities. Likewise, suburban cities maintain higher sales than rural cities. There is more variance among sales in urban cities throughout the year, but, for the most part, all of the city types remain fairly level with their sales per month.

## Conclusion
The main difference between city types is that, as population increases, total fare increases. Also, as the population increases, the cost per ride decreases. This means the CEO should find a way to decrease cost per ride so that people are more willing to ride with PyBer, which should increase average revenue per week. In addition, it is worth finding more drivers in less populated cities, as the price per driver is dramatically more in rural cities than the other two. Essentially, the CEO should strive to operate all types of cities as though they are urban areas.
